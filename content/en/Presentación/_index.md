Hello, my name is Mario and I am 20 years old.

I am a student of the higher degree of Web Application Development at the CPIFP Los Enlaces, Zaragoza.

Prior to this, I studied Multiplatform Application Development at the Satiago Hernandez institute, just after finishing high school at the same center.

Now, my goal is to finish the Web, so I can start working, preferably on something related to web pages, which is what I like the most of everything I've studied so far.

Apart from studies, I have always liked to practice any type of sport, and that is why until recently I have practiced martial arts, becoming a black belt in kenpo.

And finally, I like video games.
